# discz-take-home

## Discz iOS Take Home: Song Search - Prompt Given:
The goal of this take home is to give you a taste of something you might work on at Discz and for us to assess your iOS coding skill set.

## Project Inputs
You should have received:
- A figma file of the mocks where you can downloaded needed assets
- Attachment of GRIFTER font file

## Deliverable
Please send back an XCode project of the end result!

## Instructions
- We need to build a song/artist search flow to allow users to find songs to include their mixes and our designer just gave us these mockups for the flow
- You can use the iTunes API  or whatever you think best to power the search
- When a song is tapped, we should play the song preview that returns from the API metadata

Build the flow and send over the XCode project for review when youâ€™re done!
